User_guide:It is basically, the offline version of user guide on CodeIgniter website.

Controllers:

A controller is a simple class file. As the name suggests, it controls the whole application by URI.
<?php 
   class Test extends CI_Controller {
  
      public function index() { 
         echo "Hello World!"; 
      } 
   } 
?>
The Test class extends an in-built class called CI_Controller. This class must be extended whenever you want to make your own Controller class.
